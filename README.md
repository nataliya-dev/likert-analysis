# likert-analysis
A minimalistic python package used to visualize and analyze responses to a Likert-scale questionnaire from two or more groups.

First, I assume you have a survey for your research study. Each participant answers a survey and the answers can be exported as a .csv file. 

Second, you have two or more independent variables in your study. Generally, this means you will have two or more groups of participants each answering the same set of questions. 

The main goal of this package is not to provide publication-ready graphs and data points, but to help you visualize your incoming data as you move through your participants.

You can use this package to compare the answers from the two groups, and check if there is statistical significance for any of the questions. This package should be realtively easy to build on to.
